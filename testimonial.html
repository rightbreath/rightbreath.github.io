					<p>Torna fort - My first trekking Experience
								This was my first and long awaited trek.
						The idea of going to trekking was first suggested to me by my friend,Darshan Gugle. At first I was not easily convinced for going to a trek as I had never done it before. He assured me that this is a small trek and u will not find any difficulty in trekking . Feeling confident by Darshan's words , 
						I agreed as I needed a break and wanted to relax in the lap of nature. Our trekking destination was fixed , Torna Fort (Prachand gad) . We did small preparation in early mrng for trek and packed our bags with essential items.
						Finnaly after long wait, we left, It took 1 nd half hr. to reach this village which is base of Torna fort. As soon we reached Velhe, we had breakfast in the local eatery & started our Trek at 10.45 am.
						As we started trekking, I found it difficult and little scary at the beginning as we are at bottom level. We climbed a lot of steep slopes and I was out of breath as I had never climbed a fort before but Will power was boosted by other member of group. Meanwhile nature mesmerized me.
						We took one 15 min long break on half way & reached at 12.45 Pm on the fort. As soon as we reached at the top and Cameras came out of the bags , posers went crazy and bas photo,photo aur photo. Two Pro Singers Pooja and Nimish sang throughout the trek and other bathroom singers ( Anurag, Rushikesh, Tanu, jaya, siddhesh,myself and last but not the least Darshan Gugle) joined them later, crazy stuff like PJs, Comedy poses, Dance,etc, etc..
						Had lots of fun, Madness, Crazy Stuff and ended up my first trek. </p>

					<p>Its Monsoon again!!!! and its time to keep our annual date with the forts within pune. After successfully exploring Rajgad fort it was time to explore the Torna Fort which is very next to Rajgad fort. This was exactly how we shortlisted our trek, no reviews, manageable difficulty level, no total duration etc was taken into consideration. Finally we were 9 ppl after a lot of addition and deletion (Pooja, Anurag, Siddhesh, Jaya,Akshay, Darshan Tanaji, Rushikesh and Myself). Trek started with a curiosity to see the prime location of Torna that is Konkankada... We all started trek with a hope to complete it within 2 hours.. Thought this fort was very stiff to climb all the newcomers showed a lot of courage to climb it till the end without any hesitation. We took almost 2.30 hrs on an average to climb it. But finally it was a successful trek. While climbing we discovered this trek was risky too.. But thanks Anurag, Akshay, Darshan, Tanaji for helping the newcomers to tackle the problem of getting through the riskier part of the trek. Without you guys this trek was not at all possible. 
						Fun at the peak was the awesome part of the trek. We had lot of masti,songs, by pooja,Dance by our Robo Akshay,Pjs, Of darshan. . Overall the trek was full of masti.. Thanks everyone for making this trek a grand success. 
					Expecting the presence of everyone in the next trek too.. </p>
